# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a Grade Checker tool to the 5th Grade Success app where students can input their grade, subject, and topic to receive personalized improvement tips.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a Grade Checker section with a form containing three fields: Last Grade (letter or percentage), Subject (e.g., Math, Reading, Science, Social Studies), and Topic (free-text)
- On form submission, display a results card showing the entered info along with 4–5 personalized improvement tips based on the subject
- Show different messaging depending on grade level: encouraging message for low grades (D/below 70%), "good to great" tips for passing grades (C/70–84%), and celebratory tips for high grades (A/B/85%+)
- Style the Grade Checker section to match the existing bright, warm, playful theme (rounded cards, cheerful colors, emoji accents)
- Add "Grade Checker 📝" as the ninth entry in the TableOfContents navigation bar with smooth scroll and active-section highlighting

**User-visible outcome:** Students can navigate to the Grade Checker section, enter their last grade, subject, and struggling topic, and instantly receive personalized encouragement and improvement strategies tailored to their subject and grade level.
