  "summary": "Both REQ-5 and REQ-6 appear to be substantially implemented. The GradeChecker component handles the form with three inputs, grade-level parsing, subject-specific tips, and encouraging messages. The TableOfContents includes a 9th entry for Grade Checker with smooth-scroll and active-section highlighting. One minor discrepancy: the TableOfContents uses emoji '📊' for Grade Checker instead of the specified '📝'.",
